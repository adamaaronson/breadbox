# Breadbox 🍞
## Overview
Breadbox is an online 20-Questions-style web game created by Adam Aaronson and Cale Wolf for HackIllinois 2021.
It's built in React/SCSS with a real-time Firebase backend and is deployed on Firebase.

Check it out by playing a round with friends [here](aaronson.org/breadbox).

You can also check out our hackathon [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/breadbox-d1tflk). We placed second overall! 🎉

## Installation
After cloning, all that's required is running `npm install` to load any dependencies and `npm start` to run the React app locally.
